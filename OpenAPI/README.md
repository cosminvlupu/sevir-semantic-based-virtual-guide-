We're going to use OpenAPI version 3.1.0 to make connections between the Backoffice and Frontend and between BackOffice and Database.

We have came up with 2 examples of usages, one for the User Schema, where new users will register and the existent one can log in and use the app as intended. The second example is the Location file, where we the user will set his location and we will then use other API to search the link of the location, if there is something around and how to arrive there.

Until we start implementing the modules, this will be prototypes of later updates
